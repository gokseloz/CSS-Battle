# CSS Battle

CSS Battle is a concept where people can use there CSS skills to climb in the leaderboard. Me personally uses CSS Battle to get better with all the diffrent CSS techniques. The solutions you find here below are probably not the best solutions but it will do for a 100% score (If you want to climb the leaderboard you have to refactor the code with less characters to get a higher rating).
